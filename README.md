# Face mask detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Face mask detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)is a popular application of deep learning for computer vision tasks. The goal is to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in an image or video stream.

Here's a general approach to building a face mask detection system using CNNs:

### Dataset Collection:

Gather a dataset consisting of images or video frames labeled as "with mask" or "without mask." 

### Data Preprocessing

Preprocess the collected dataset. Resize the images to a consistent size and normalize the pixel values to a suitable range (e.g., [0, 1]). Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring that both classes ("with mask" and "without mask") are represented in each set.

### Building the CNN Model:

Design and build a CNN model using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow. A typical CNN architecture for face mask detection may consist of multiple convolutional layers, followed by maxpooling layers, fully connected layers, and an output layer.

### Training the Model: 

Train the CNN model using the prepared training dataset. During training, the model learns to differentiate between images with and without masks by adjusting its internal weights based on the provided labels.

### Model Evaluation: 

Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset. Calculate metrics such as accuracy andloss to assess the model's performance. 

It's worth noting that in real-world applications, face mask detection is often combined with face detection and/or face recognition to identify and track individuals wearing masks.
